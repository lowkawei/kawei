        </table>        <h2>Date Rape</h2>
        <p>While most people take party drugs for recreation, the sad fact is that some lowlifes also use them to spike other's drinks, not only at rave or dance parties, but also in pubs, bars and nightclubs. Although drink spiking is no new practice, it is a serious concern particularly when it leads to sexual assault or what's known as 'date rape'. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 4500 people reported having had their drink spiked in 2003.</p>
        <p>Alcohol is still the main additive used to spike drinks. But because alcohol can often be detected in a drink and because the effects of alcohol take a certain amount of time to become apparent on the victim, other drugs are more dangerous when used to spike drinks. The two major drugs used for drink spiking in the rave/club scene are Ketamine (also known as Special K) and GBH (nicknamed Grievous Bodily Harm and for good reason), alongside prescription medications such as Rohypnol, Xanax and Valium.</p>
        <p>Most of these drugs are difficult to detect as they are often colourless, odourless and flavourless. But these drugs can leave the victim feeling dizzy, disoriented, confused, or even with no recollection of the events after drinking the adulterated beverage. As such, these drugs can be used to aid sexual assault of the victim. Women aged 16&ndash;24 are particularly at risk. In Australia about 25 per cent of sexual assault victims <a href="http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/article.asp?id=4912&ContainerID=529" target="_blank">reported having been drugged</a> in 2002.</p>

        <p>There are ways to minimise the risks of drink spiking and date rape. Talk to your friends about ways to look after each other when you're out on a social night. In particular do not accept drinks you didn't watch being made yourself and do not leave your drink unattended at any time. <a href="http://drinksafetech.com.au" target="_blank">Drink Spike Detectors</a> are also good backups to have with you when you go out; these pocket-sized cards let you test for GBH and Ketamine in any drink, simply by putting a drop of your drink onto the test card. They are available at Amcal and Guardian pharmacies. Remember, too, that a drink spiker won't necessarily be a stranger; after all, 'date rape' got its name from victims being assaulted by someone they know. </p>

            <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><p class="style26">In Australia, the laws regarding illicit drugs differ between states. However, the four main offences relating to drugs are use, possession, cultivation and trafficking. <strong>Drug use</strong> means introducing a drug of dependence into your body, or someone else's (which is why drink spiking is illegal). <strong>Drug possession</strong> refers to having custody or control of a drug of dependence, either with you or on your property. <strong>Drug cultivation</strong> refers to the growing of any drug of dependence. The penalties for drug use, possession and cultivation vary, depending on whether the offence is related to <strong>drug trafficking</strong>. Drug trafficking is a serious offence, and can lead to up to 25 years imprisonment, as well as large fines. </p>
